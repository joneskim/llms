## Introduction

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to setting up the development environment for the Local Learning Management System (LLMS). The LLMS is a 
web-based application that allows users to manage and track their learning progress.

The setup process involves installing Python and Node.js, creating virtual environments, installing dependencies, running servers, and configuring environment 
variables. This documentation aims to provide detailed instructions on how to perform these tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the setup process, ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

* **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux
* **Python:** Version 3.8 or later
* **Node.js:** Version 14.x or later (includes npm)

### Python Installation

To install Python, follow these steps:

1. Download the Python installer from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer, and make sure to check the option to "Add Python to PATH" during installation.

Alternatively, you can use a package manager like Homebrew (macOS) or your package manager (Linux):

```bash
brew install python  # macOS
sudo apt-get install python3  # Ubuntu/Linux
```

### Node.js and npm Installation

To install Node.js, follow these steps:

1. Download the Node.js installer from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Run the installer, and make sure to check the option to "Add Node.js to PATH" during installation.

Alternatively, you can use a package manager like Homebrew (macOS) or your package manager (Linux):

```bash
brew install node  # macOS
sudo apt-get install nodejs npm  # Ubuntu/Linux
```

After installation, verify the installation by running:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Backend Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment for your backend project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
python -m venv llms-backend-env
```
This will create a new virtual environment named `llms-backend-env`.

### Install Backend Dependencies

To install dependencies for your backend project, follow these steps:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
        * **Windows:** `llms-backend-env\Scripts\activate`
        * **macOS and Linux:** `source llms-backend-env/bin/activate`
2. Run the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all dependencies listed in your `requirements.txt` file.

### Run the Backend Server

To run the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Activate the virtual environment:
        * **Windows:** `llms-backend-env\Scripts\activate`
        * **macOS and Linux:** `source llms-backend-env/bin/activate`
2. Run the following command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the backend server.

## Frontend Setup

### Install Frontend Dependencies

To install dependencies for your frontend project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install all dependencies listed in your `package.json` file.

### Run the Frontend Server

To run the frontend server, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
This will start the frontend server.

## Additional Configuration

### Setting up a Requirements File

To set up a requirements file for your backend project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory.
2. Add the dependencies you want to install to the file, one per line:
```text
numpy==1.20.0
pandas==1.3.5
```
### Configuring Environment Variables

To configure environment variables for your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `env.py` in your project directory.
2. Add the environment variables you want to set, one per line:
```python
import os
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'llms.settings'
```
## Services Setup

### Data Analysis Service

To set up the data analysis service, follow these steps:

1. Create a new file named `data_analysis_service.py` in your project directory.
2. Add the following code:
```python
import pandas as pd

def analyze_data(df):
    # Analyze the data and return the results
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
    analyze_data(df)
```
This service will read a CSV file named `data.csv` and analyze the data using the `pandas` library.

## Troubleshooting Tips

* If you encounter any issues during the setup process, try checking the installation logs for errors.
* Make sure to activate the correct virtual environment before running your code.
* Verify that all dependencies are installed correctly by running `pip freeze` and `npm list`.
* Check the server logs for any error messages if the backend or frontend servers fail to start.
